\title{Filter and Align GWAS Data to a Reference Panel}
\usage{
merge_gwas(gwas_data_list, ref_panel)
}
\arguments{
\item{gwas_data_list}{A list of data.frames where each data.frame contains GWAS summary statistics for a trait. Each data.frame should include columns for SNP identifiers, Z-scores of effect size estimates, sample sizes (N), effect allele (A1), and reference allele (A2).}

\item{ref_panel}{A data.frame containing the reference panel data. It must include columns for SNP, A1, and A2.}
}
\value{
A list of data.frames, each corresponding to an input GWAS summary statistics data frame, but filtered, harmonized, and aligned to the common SNPs found across all data frames.
}
\description{
The \code{merge_gwas} function processes a list of GWAS summary statistics data frames, harmonizes alleles according to a reference panel, removes duplicates, and aligns data to common SNPs. It's used to prepare data for further analysis such as LDSC.
}
\details{
The function performs several key steps: adjusting alleles according to a reference panel, removing duplicate SNPs, and aligning all GWAS data frames to a set of common SNPs. This is often a necessary preprocessing step before performing genetic correlation and heritability analyses.
}
\examples{
# Assuming GWAS_List and ref_panel are already defined:
GWAS_List <- merge_gwas(GWAS_List, ref_panel)

}
